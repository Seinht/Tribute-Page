            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Nine was one of the two former protagonists of the story. He is a calm and composed teenager, and one out of the two the masterminds behind Sphinx, an unknown terrorist group that he partners with his childhood friend, Twelve. His motives and identity are enshrouded in mystery.</p>
            <h2>History Of Nine</h2>
            <h3>EARLY LI<span id="highlight">F</span>E</h3>
            <p>Nine, whose real name is Arata Kokonoe, was one of the children involved in a secretive and cruel government experiment known as the Athena Project. This project aimed to create highly intelligent and capable children who could be used as human weapons. The children, including Nine and his friend Twelve, were subjected to rigorous and often inhumane training and experimentation. <br>Despite the harsh conditions, Nine's intelligence and resilience stood out. He developed a deep bond with Twelve, and together they planned their escape from the facility. Their traumatic experiences and the desire for freedom forged an unbreakable bond between the two boys.</p>
            <h3>THE ESC<span id="highlight">A</span>PE</h3>
            <p>Nine and Twelve successfully escaped from the facility, leaving behind the horrors of the Athena Project. They went underground, adopting new identities and hiding from the authorities. However, the memories of their past and the injustice they suffered haunted them. They vowed to expose the truth behind the Athena Project and seek justice for themselves and the other children who were not as fortunate.</p>
            <h3>LIFE A<span id="highlight">S</span> SPHINX</h3>
            <p>Adopting the code names Sphinx One (Nine) and Sphinx Two (Twelve), they began a series of carefully orchestrated terrorist attacks in Tokyo. These attacks were designed to draw attention to the corruption and unethical practices of the government, particularly the existence of the Athena Project. They used their intelligence and strategic skills to create elaborate puzzles and riddles that the police had to solve to prevent the attacks. <br>Nine was the mastermind behind the plans, his calm and calculating demeanor often in stark contrast to Twelve's more playful and spontaneous nature. Together, they challenged the authorities, especially Detective Shibazaki, who began to unravel the mystery behind Sphinx.</p>
            <h3>THE CONFR<span id="highlight">O</span>NTATION WITH FIVE</h3>
            <p>During their operations, Nine and Twelve encountered Five, a former compatriot from the Athena Project. Unlike Nine and Twelve, Five had been captured and remained under the control of the organization behind the project. She was brought in to capture Nine and Twelve, leading to a tense and dangerous cat-and-mouse game. <br>Five's involvement brought back painful memories for Nine, intensifying his resolve to expose the truth. The confrontation with Five escalated the stakes, leading to more dangerous and high-profile attacks.</p>
            <h3>THE FI<span id="highlight">N</span>AL ACT</h3>
            <p>As the series progressed, Nine's health deteriorated due to the lingering effects of the experiments conducted on him. Despite this, he remained focused on their mission. The climax of their efforts came when they revealed their ultimate plan: a massive attack meant to expose the government's corruption and the existence of the Athena Project to the world. <br>In the end, Nine and Twelve's actions succeeded in drawing significant attention to their cause. However, their journey was marked by tragedy. Twelve was killed in a confrontation with the authorities, and Nine, after ensuring that their message would be heard, was taken into custody. Despite the somber ending, their mission to reveal the truth was achieved, and the world learned about the horrors of the Athena Project.</p>
            <h3>LE<span id="highlight">G</span>ACY</h3>
            <p>Nine's journey is one of resilience, intelligence, and a relentless pursuit of justice. His actions, though controversial, were driven by a desire to expose corruption and seek retribution for the suffering inflicted upon him and other innocent children. Nine's legacy is a testament to the enduring spirit of those who fight against injustice, even when the odds are overwhelmingly against them.</p>
